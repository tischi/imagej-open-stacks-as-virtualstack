<h3>Object size</h3>
<p width=400>
    The tracking is based on computing the center of mass in a region whose
    size you can adjust here. The size should be large enough <b>to enclose one</b> of
    your objects of interest, but small enough <b>not to enclose two</b> objects
    as this can cause the algorithm to 'switch' objects during tracking. Please note
    that you can change the object size at any point; the 'Object size' is  read again any time you
    click the 'Track selected object' button. This means that you can subsequently track objects of
    different sizes.

<h3>Tracking sub-sampling</h3>
<p width=400>
    To increase the tracking speed you can analyse only every dx,dy,dz data point.
    Especially when working with Tiff stacks this will help as loading only every dz plane will be much faster.
    Center of mass computation is so fast that dx and dy sub-sampling do not help much.
    However, for the correlation-based tracking dx and dy sub-subsampling makes a big difference in speed.

<h3>Track length</h3>
<p width=400>
    Here, you can specify the number of frames that you would like to track the object.
    Please note that you do <b>not</b> need to start tracking at the first frame.
    Simply move the time slider on the image forward and then select an object and click
    'Track selected object'. Also note that you can track different objects for different
    lengths.

<h3>Track selected object</h3>
<p width=400>
    Use ImageJ's Point Selection tool to select an object in the image and then
    hit this button to start its tracking.
    The tracking is based on computing the center of mass of all the gray-scale values
    within above chosen radii (as a threshold only values above the mean gray value within
    twice above chosen radii are taken into account).
    You do not have to wait for the tracking of one object
    to be finished; you can immediately track another object.

<h3>Show tracked objects</h3>
<p width=400>
    Opens as many new image windows as there are completed tracks.
    Each image window shows the data locally surrounding the respective track.
    The size of the shown region can be adjusted by the changing the values in 'Cropping radii'.

<h4>Main ideas behind this functionality</h4>
<p width=400>
    One often wants to observe morphological changes of moving objects.
    It is however very challenging for the human brain
    to focus on the morphological changes as it is distracted by the object's motion.
    Thus, having a 'stabilized view' on the object, where its translocation is eliminated is
    very helpful.
    In addition, the 'stabilized view' also reduces the amount of data needed to further study the object.

<h3>Tracking Method</h3>
<p width=400>
    You can choose between 'center of mass' and 'correlation'.
    For 'correlation'the position of the first time-point is determined as its center of mass.
    The position of subsequent time-points is however determined relative to the previous time-point by
    computing the shift leading to the maximal cross-correlation between the signals.
